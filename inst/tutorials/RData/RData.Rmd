## Course Overview

It's great that you can create computer programs in R, but what should we make those computer programs do? R is used frequently for data science and statistical applications, and in this module, you'll be introduced to how R is used to work with data.

By the end of the course module, you will be able to:

-   Set up new RStudio projects.
-   Apply vector and matrix operations.
-   Load and manipulate data in data frames.

### Prerequisites

Prior to completing this course module, you should have complete the other modules in the R for Everyone Series:

-   R for Everyone - Part 1: The Basics
-   R for Everyone - Part 2: Computer Programming

You will need to have both R and RStudio installed, and you will be viewing this course through RStudio.

## Setting Up RStudio Projects

*Lesson Objective: Set up an R Project.*

Up to this point in the R for Everyone series, you haven't needed to set up an RStudio Project. However, now that we'll start working with data, it's a good idea to get into the habit of using RStudio Projects to organize your work..

By using **RStudio Projects**, you can ensure all the data, code, and documentation for your projects are accessible in a single place.

To create a new project, go to *File -\> New Project...* from the top menu. In the window the appears, select *New Directory -\> New Project*. Then give your project a name and choose where to save your project. ![](images/new_directory.png){width="100%"}

This will create a new folder in the location where you chose to save your new project. In this folder, you should now see a *.Rproj* file. You can use this *.Rproj* file as a shortcut to opening your project in RStudio.

Go ahead and create a new *.Rproj* to organize your work for this course module. Inside of the project folder, create a new *data* directory. You can take a look at the **Files** pane to see all the files within your RStudio project.

![](images/files_pane.png){width="100%"}

If you are completing this module within RStudio, go ahead and download [this csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCSF-DSI/UCSFDSILearnr/main/data/grades.csv) (click link -\> *right click* -\> *Save As...*), and add it to your *data* folder in your project.

## Vectors and Matrices

*Lesson Objective: Apply vector and matrix operations.*

Suppose you are a teacher, and the table below displays your students' grades.

| student  | assignment1_grade | assignment2_grade | test_grade |
|:---------|:------------------|:------------------|:-----------|
| Albert   | 80                | 90                | 65         |
| Enrico   | 90                | 85                | 70         |
| Ian      | 85                | 100               | 80         |
| Michelle | 85                | 85                | 75         |
| Namari   | 90                | 95                | 75         |

It looks like our students didn't do as well on the test. Let's try to apply a curve of 5 points to the test.

```{r exercise_02a, exercise=TRUE}
# assign grades to students
grade_albert <- 65
grade_enrico <- 70
grade_ian <- 80
grade_michelle <- 75
grade_namari <- 75

# apply 5 point curve
grade_albert <- grade_albert + 5
grade_enrico <- grade_enrico + 5
grade_ian <- grade_ian + 5
grade_michelle <- grade_michelle + 5
grade_namari <- grade_namari + 5

# display grades
print(grade_albert)
print(grade_enrico)
print(grade_ian)
print(grade_michelle)
print(grade_namari)
```

In the code above, we assigned the test grade of every student to separate objects, and then we added 5 to each object. Although this works, you may have noticed that it is repetitive. There are different objects for different student's scores, and we are applying the same mathematical operation (add 5) to all the objects. Is there a more efficient way to do this? The short answer is yes!

### Vectors

**Vectors** are sequences of values. Let's revisit the example from above, but this time, we'll use a vector.

```{r exercise_02b, exercise=TRUE}
# assign grades to students
grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

# apply 5 point curve
grades <- grades + 5

# display grades
print(grades)
```

As you see, we were able to store all the grades in a single object as a vector using the `c()` function, and when we applied the curve, all the grades within the vector were adjusted in a single operation.

#### Indexing Vectors

You can also adjust individual values within vectors. Let's just say there was a grading error on Albert's test, and his final test grade should actually be 75. Let's see how that can be done.

```{r exercise_02csetup, include=FALSE}
grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)
grades <- grades + 5
```

```{r exercise_02c, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02csetup"}
# adjust Albert's test grade
grades[1] <- 75

# display grades
print(grades)
```

Here you see that you can **index** or select specific values within a vector by using square brackets `[ ]`. Since Albert's test grade is the first value within the *grades* vector, we use the index `[1]`. There are some other ways to index as well.

```{r exercise_02dsetup, include=FALSE}
grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)
grades <- grades + 5
grades[1] <- 75
```

```{r exercise_02d, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02dsetup"}
# index a single value
print(grades[1])

# index a sequence of values
print(grades[1:3])

# index based on a condition
print(grades[grades > 80])
```

In fact, the values inside of the square brackets are vectors as well!

-   `1` is a vector of **length** 1.

-   `1:3` is a **sequence** (`c(1, 2, 3)`).

-   `grades > 80` is a vector with boolean values (`c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)`).

#### Knowledge Check

Write some code based on the description below:

    Assign students names to an object named `students`
    Assign assignment 1 grades to an object named `assignment1_grades`
    Assign assignment 2 grades to an object named `assignment2_grades`

    Index the `students` vector and include only those who scored 85 and above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers` and print the results.

| student  | assignment1_grade | assignment2_grade | test_grade |
|:---------|:------------------|:------------------|:-----------|
| Albert   | 80                | 90                | 65         |
| Enrico   | 90                | 85                | 70         |
| Ian      | 85                | 100               | 80         |
| Michelle | 85                | 85                | 75         |
| Namari   | 90                | 95                | 75         |

You can reveal the solution once you are comfortable with your response

```{r KC2a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=15}
# YOUR WORK HERE

# Assign students names to an object named `students`


# Assign assignment 1 grades to an object named `assignment1_grades`


# Assign assignment 2 grades to an object named `assignment2_grades`


# Index the `students` vector and include only those that scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers`.


# Print `high_achievers`


```

```{r KC2a-solution}
# Assign students names to an object named `students`
students <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")

# Assign assignment 1 grades to an object named `assignment1_grades`
assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)

# Assign assignment 2 grades to an object named `assignment2_grades`
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)

# Index the `students` vector and include only those that scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers`.
high_achievers <- students[assignment1_grades >= 85 & assignment2_grades >= 90]

# Print `high_achievers`
print(high_achievers)
```

### Matrices

As useful as vectors are, they are 1-dimensional (literally!), and most data isn't. Even with our table of students grades, the data is 2-dimensional (includes both rows and columns).

You can use **matrices** to work with 2-dimensional data. Let's take a look.

```{r exercise_02e, exercise=TRUE}
all_grades <- matrix(
  c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90, 90, 85, 100, 85, 95, 65, 70, 80, 75, 75),
  nrow = 5,
  ncol = 3
)

print(all_grades)
```

Using the `matrix()` function, we can specify the values, number of rows, and number of columns in our matrix. This isn't always practical, and as you can see above, it's hard to keep track of which values are assignment 1 grades, assignment 2 grades, and test grades in `c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90, 90, 85, 100, 85, 95, 65, 70, 80, 75, 75)`.

A better way to do this is to leverage vectors.

```{r exercise_02f, exercise=TRUE}

assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)
test_grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

all_grades <- cbind(assignment1_grades, assignment2_grades, test_grades)

# display grades
print(all_grades)
```

By using the `cbind()` function, we're able to make each vector a column in our new matrix. Another useful function for combining vectors into matrices is the `rbind()` function which makes each vector a row.

By using vectors to create your matrix, you make your code easier to read. You may have also notices that `cbind()` automatically named the columns of your matrix based on the names of the vectors. Likewise, `rbind()` will name the rows of your matrix based on the vector names. Let's go ahead and name the rows of the `all_grades` matrix.

```{r exercise_02gsetup, include=FALSE}

assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)
test_grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

all_grades <- cbind(assignment1_grades, assignment2_grades, test_grades)
```

```{r exercise_02g, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02gsetup"}

rownames(all_grades) <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")
colnames(all_grades) <- c("assignment1_grades", "assignment2_grades", "test_grades")

# display grades
print(all_grades)
```

By using the `rownames()` and `colnames()` functions, we can name the rows and columns of our matrices. This makes it easier to index values in your matrix.

#### Indexing Matrices

Indexing matrices is very similar to indexing vectors, and you will use square brackets (`[ ]`) as well. However, unlike vectors, you have to index both the rows and columns of a matrix. Let's take a look at a few examples.

```{r exercise_02hsetup, include=FALSE}

assignment1_grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)
assignment2_grades <- c(90, 85, 100, 85, 95)
test_grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

all_grades <- cbind(assignment1_grades, assignment2_grades, test_grades)

rownames(all_grades) <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")
colnames(all_grades) <- c("assignment1_grades", "assignment2_grades", "test_grades")
```

```{r exercise_02h, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02hsetup"}

# Select all columns in the first row
print(all_grades[1, ])

# Select all rows in the second column
print(all_grades[, 2])

# Select Albert, Enrico, and Namari's assignment 1 and assignment 2 grades
print(
  all_grades[
    c("Albert", "Enrico", "Namari"),
    c("assignment1_grades", "assignment2_grades")
  ]
)
```

Here are some key observations based on the examples:

-   The square brackets all follow the form of `[row_indices, column_indices]`.

-   Both row and column indices are vectors

-   To select all rows or all columns, you still need to include the comma, and you would leave out either the row indices or column indices based on what you are selecting.

-   You can index using integers (based on position within matrix) or row/column names.

Similar to vectors, you can also use logic (vector of boolean values) to index matrices.

```{r exercise_02i, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_02hsetup"}

# Select all rows where assignment 2 grade was 90 or above
print(
  all_grades[all_grades[, "assignment2_grades"] >= 90, ]
)
```

#### Knowledge Check

Write some code based on the description below:

    Index the `all_grades` matrix and include only students who scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers` and print the results. As a bonus, try modifying `high_achievers` so it only contains the student names.

    Hint: Your results should be the same as the previous Knowledge Check's results.

| student  | assignment1_grade | assignment2_grade | test_grade |
|:---------|:------------------|:------------------|:-----------|
| Albert   | 80                | 90                | 65         |
| Enrico   | 90                | 85                | 70         |
| Ian      | 85                | 100               | 80         |
| Michelle | 85                | 85                | 75         |
| Namari   | 90                | 95                | 75         |

You can reveal the solution once you are comfortable with your response

```{r KC2b, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10, exercise.setup="exercise_02hsetup"}
# YOUR WORK HERE

# Index the `all_grades` matrix and include only students who scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers`.


# As a bonus, try modifying `high_achievers` so it only contains the student names.


# Print `high_achievers`


```

```{r KC2b-solution}

# Index the `all_grades` matrix and include only students who scored 85 or above on assignment 1 and 90 or above on assignment 2. Store the results in an object called `high_achievers`.
high_achievers <- all_grades[
  all_grades[, "assignment1_grades"] >= 85 & all_grades[, "assignment2_grades"] >= 90,
]
# As a bonus, try modifying `high_achievers` so it only contains the student names.
high_achievers <- rownames(high_achievers)

# Print `high_achievers`
print(high_achievers)

```

## Data Frames

*Lesson Objective: Load and manipulate data in data frames.*

With a matrix, you can now work with 2-dimensional data. However, one of matrix's limitations (or feature depending on your perspective) is that all values must be the same type. However, the data you're working with often contains multiple types of values.

To explore this, go ahead and run the code below.

```{r exercise_03setup, include=FALSE}
dir.create("data")
grades <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCSF-DSI/UCSFDSILearnr/main/data/course_records"))
write.csv(grades, "data/grades.csv", row.names=FALSE)
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r exercise_03a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_03setup"}
# Read data from course_records.csv and assign it to course_records
course_records <- read.csv("data/course_records.csv")
View(course_records)
```

In the code above, we imported data from a **CSV (comma separated values)** file, using the `read.csv()`
