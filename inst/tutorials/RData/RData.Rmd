## Course Overview

It's great that you can create computer programs in R, why what should we make those computer programs do? R is used frequently for data science and statistical applications, and in this module, you'll get a basic understanding of how data scientists use R.

By the end of the course module, you will be able to:

-   Set up new RStudio projects.
-   Apply vector and matrix operations.
-   Load and manipulate data in data frames.

### Prerequisites

Prior to completing this course module, you should have complete the other modules in the R for Everyone Series:

-   R for Everyone - Part 1: The Basics
-   R for Everyone - Part 2: Computer Programming

You will need to have both R and RStudio installed, and you will be viewing this course through RStudio.

## Setting Up RStudio Projects

*Lesson Objective: Set up an R Project.*

Up to this point in the R for Everyone series, you haven't needed to set up an RStudio Project. However, now that we'll start working with data, it's a good idea to get into a habit to organize your projects.

By using **RStudio projects**, you can ensure all the data, scripts, and documentation for your projects are in a single place.

To create a new project, go to *File -\> New Project...* from the top menu. In the window the appears, select *New Directory -\> New Project*. Then give your project a name and choose where to save your project. ![](images/new_directory.png){width="100%"}

This will create a new folder in the location where you chose to save your new project. In this folder, you should now see a *.Rproj* file. You can use this *.Rproj* file as a shortcut to opening your project in RStudio.

## Vectors and Matrices

*Lesson Objective: Apply vector and matrix operations.*

Sometimes, we want to apply a mathematical operation to a sequence of values. For example, take a look at the code below:

```{r exercise_02a, exercise=TRUE}
# assign grades to students
grade_albert <- 80
grade_enrico <- 90
grade_ian <- 85
grade_michelle <- 85
grade_namari <- 90

# apply 5 point curve
grade_albert <- grade_albert + 5
grade_enrico <- grade_enrico + 5
grade_ian <- grade_ian + 5
grade_michelle <- grade_michelle + 5
grade_namari <- grade_namari + 5

# display grades
print(grade_albert)
print(grade_enrico)
print(grade_ian)
print(grade_michelle)
print(grade_namari)
```

You may have noticed that this code is repetitive,. There are different objects for different students, and we are applying the same mathematical operation (add 5) to all the objects. Is there a more efficient way to do this? The short answer is yes!

### Vectors

**Vectors** are sequences of values. Let's revisit the example from above, but this time, we'll use a vector.

```{r exercise_02b, exercise=TRUE}
# assign grades to students
grades <- c(80, 90, 85, 85, 90)

# apply 5 point curve
grades <- grades + 5

# display grades
print(grades)
```

As you see, we were able to store all the grades in a single object as a vector, and when we applied the curve, all the grades within the vector were adjusted in a single operation.

There are two types of vectors:

-   Atomic Vectors

-   Lists

#### Atomic Vectors

**Atomic vectors** are vectors that only contain a single data type. In our example above, all the values within the `grades` vector were integers. However, you can have other types of values in vectors as well. Take a look at the examples below:

```{r exercise_02c, exercise=TRUE}
# this vector contains logical (boolean) values
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

# this vector contains strings of characters
character_vector <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")
```

#### Lists

Unlike atomic vectors, lists can contain multiple types of values. Take a look at the example below:

```{r exercise_02d, exercise=TRUE}
x <- list("1", 2, "three", 4, "five")
```

In the example, we included both string and numeric values in vector `x`.

## Data Frames

*Lesson Objective: Load and manipulate data in data frames.*

## Summary
