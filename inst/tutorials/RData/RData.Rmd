## Course Overview

It's great that you can create computer programs in R, but what should we make those computer programs do? R is used frequently for data science and statistical applications, and in this module, you'll be introduced to how R is used to work with data.

By the end of the course module, you will be able to:

-   Set up new RStudio projects.
-   Apply vector and matrix operations.
-   Load and manipulate data in data frames.

### Prerequisites

Prior to completing this course module, you should have complete the other modules in the R for Everyone Series:

-   R for Everyone - Part 1: The Basics
-   R for Everyone - Part 2: Computer Programming

You will need to have both R and RStudio installed, and you will be viewing this course through RStudio.

## Setting Up RStudio Projects

*Lesson Objective: Set up an R Project.*

Up to this point in the R for Everyone series, you haven't needed to set up an RStudio Project. However, now that we'll start working with data, it's a good idea to get into the habit of using RStudio Projects to organize your work..

By using **RStudio Projects**, you can ensure all the data, code, and documentation for your projects are accessible in a single place.

To create a new project, go to *File -\> New Project...* from the top menu. In the window the appears, select *New Directory -\> New Project*. Then give your project a name and choose where to save your project. ![](images/new_directory.png){width="100%"}

This will create a new folder in the location where you chose to save your new project. In this folder, you should now see a *.Rproj* file. You can use this *.Rproj* file as a shortcut to opening your project in RStudio.

Go ahead and create a new *.Rproj* to organize your work for this course module. Inside of the project folder, create a new *data* directory. You can take a look at the **Files** pane to see all the files within your RStudio project.

If you are completing this module within RStudio, go ahead and download [this csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCSF-DSI/UCSFDSILearnr/main/data/grades.csv) (click link -\> *right click* -\> *Save As...*), and add it to your *data* folder in your project.

## Vectors

*Lesson Objective: Apply vector and matrix operations.*

Suppose you are a teacher, and the table below displays your students' grades.

| student  | assignment1_grade | assignment2_grade | test_grade |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Albert   | 80                | 90                | 65         |
| Enrico   | 90                | 85                | 70         |
| Ian      | 85                | 100               | 80         |
| Michelle | 85                | 85                | 75         |
| Namari   | 90                | 95                | 75         |

It looks like our students didn't do as well on the test. Let's try to apply a curve of 5 points to the test.

```{r exercise_02a, exercise=TRUE}
# assign grades to students
grade_albert <- 65
grade_enrico <- 70
grade_ian <- 80
grade_michelle <- 75
grade_namari <- 75

# apply 5 point curve
grade_albert <- grade_albert + 5
grade_enrico <- grade_enrico + 5
grade_ian <- grade_ian + 5
grade_michelle <- grade_michelle + 5
grade_namari <- grade_namari + 5

# display grades
print(grade_albert)
print(grade_enrico)
print(grade_ian)
print(grade_michelle)
print(grade_namari)
```

In the code above, we assigned the test grade of every student to separate objects, and then we added 5 to each object. Although this works, you may have noticed that it is repetitive. There are different objects for different student's scores, and we are applying the same mathematical operation (add 5) to all the objects. Is there a more efficient way to do this? The short answer is yes!

**Vectors** are sequences of values. Let's revisit the example from above, but this time, we'll use a vector.

```{r exercise_02b, exercise=TRUE}
# assign grades to students
grades <- c(65, 70, 80, 75, 75)

# apply 5 point curve
grades <- grades + 5

# display grades
print(grades)
```

As you see, we were able to store all the grades in a single object as a vector, and when we applied the curve, all the grades within the vector were adjusted in a single operation.

### Types of Vectors

There are two types of vectors:

-   Atomic Vectors

-   Lists

#### Atomic Vectors

**Atomic vectors** are vectors that only contain a single data type. In our example above, all the values within the `grades` vector were integers. However, you can have other types of values in vectors as well. Take a look at the examples below:

```{r exercise_02c, exercise=TRUE}
# this vector contains numeric values
numeric_vector <- c(65.0, 70.0, 80.0, 75.0, 75.0)

# this vector contains logical (boolean) values
logical_vector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

# this vector contains strings of characters
character_vector <- c("Albert", "Enrico", "Ian", "Michelle", "Namari")
```

#### Lists

Unlike atomic vectors, lists can contain multiple types of values. Take a look at the example below:

```{r exercise_02d, exercise=TRUE}
x <- list("1", 2, "three", 4, "five")
```

In the example, we included both string and numeric values in vector `x`.

## Data Frames

*Lesson Objective: Load and manipulate data in data frames.*

```{r exercise_03setup, include=FALSE}
dir.create("data")
grades <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCSF-DSI/UCSFDSILearnr/main/data/grades.csv"))
write.csv(grades, "data/grades.csv", row.names=FALSE)
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r exercise_03a, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="exercise_03setup"}


```

## Summary

**Key Concepts**

-   By using **RStudio projects**, you can ensure all the data, scripts, and documentation for your projects are in a single place.
