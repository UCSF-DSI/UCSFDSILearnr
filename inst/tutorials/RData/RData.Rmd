## Course Overview

It's great that you can create computer programs in R, why what should we make those computer programs do? R is used frequently for data science and statistical applications, and in this module, you'll get a basic understanding of how data scientists use R.

By the end of the course module, you will be able to:

-   Set up new RStudio projects.
-   Apply vector and matrix operations.
-   Load and manipulate data in data frames.

### Prerequisites

Prior to completing this course module, you should have complete the other modules in the R for Everyone Series:

-   R for Everyone - Part 1: The Basics
-   R for Everyone - Part 2: Computer Programming

You will need to have both R and RStudio installed, and you will be viewing this course through RStudio.

## Setting Up RStudio Projects

*Lesson Objective: Set up an R Project.*

Up to this point in the R for Everyone series, you haven't needed to set up an RStudio Project. However, now that we'll start working with data, it's a good idea to get into a habit to organize your projects.

By using **RStudio projects**, you can ensure all the data, scripts, and documentation for your projects are in a single place.

To create a new project, go to *File -\> New Project...* from the top menu. In the window the appears, select *New Directory -\> New Project*. Then give your project a name and choose where to save your project. ![](images/new_directory.png){width="100%"}

This will create a new folder in the location where you chose to save your new project. In this folder, you should now see a *.Rproj* file. You can use this *.Rproj* file as a shortcut to opening your project in RStudio.

## Vectors and Matrices

*Lesson Objective: Apply vector and matrix operations.*

## Data Frames

*Lesson Objective: Load and manipulate data in data frames.*
