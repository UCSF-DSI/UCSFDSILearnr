## Course Overview

We define **statistics** as using math to make sense of data. In this module, you will explore **descriptive statistics**, which is using statistics to describe data.

By the end of the course module, you will be able to:

-   Categorize different types of statistical variables.

-   Create and interpret visualizations to describe numerical variables.

-   Create and interpret visualizations to describe categorical variables.

-   Create and interpret visualizations to describe relationships between variables.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have both R and RStudio installed, and you will be viewing this course through RStudio.

Prior to completing this course module, you should have complete the modules in the R for Everyone Series.
